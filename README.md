## My Task

1. Clone the starter code into my repository
2. Select a specific Regex I would like to explain
3. Use GitGist to write the tutorial on how it works

## User Story

```md
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
```
